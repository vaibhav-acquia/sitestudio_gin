# Acquia Site Studio Gin

A small integration module to allow projects using Acquia Site Studio to
use the Gin administration theme.

If you're using Site Studio as part of Acquia CMS, you may also want to use
[Acquia CMS Toolbar Gin](https://www.drupal.org/project/acquia_cms_toolbar_gin),
which improves the look of the secondary toolbar with Gin.
